There are two main ways of using the mv command: 
	 
	1) mv renames the original file to the destination path renamed. This form of the mv command is assumed when the operator does not name an already existing directory 
	 
	2) mv moves each file named to a destination file in the existing directory. 
	 
	see man mv for more details
